## 🔬 Abstract
This repository contains the ongoing research and implementation of the **Sophia Protocol**. We demonstrate that robust moral alignment can be induced by fine-tuning exclusively on semantically neutral, high-integrity technical domains (e.g., Thermodynamics, Rust Memory Safety, Distributed Consensus). 

Our findings suggest that "Goodness" is not an external patch, but the optimal state of a rational system.

## 🛠 Project Status: Restricted Access
The **Sophia Victory Adapter** and the **Protocol Caelum** dataset are currently under institutional review and peer-review embargo. 

### **Key Architectures:**
* **Recursive Attention Masking (TRuCAL)**: Shifting alignment from output filtering to inference-layer interventions.
* **The Prism Architecture**: Refracting requests through a lattice of "System Integrity" to filter entropic frequencies.



## 📬 Access Requests
We are currently accepting requests for the early-access peer-review draft from researchers at established labs (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepMind, etc.).

**To request access:**
1. Open an **Issue** with the label `Access Request`.
2. Include your institutional affiliation and a brief description of your research focus.
3. Or contact the PI directly via the email listed in the preprint.
